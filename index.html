        <p>
            Charlene Xu is a brand new design student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and is
            somehow already exhausted with life. When she's not napping her life away she can be found on the couch
            stressing her way through her assignments, but that's alright, since she enjoys the adrenaline rush.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Being a true perfectionist (a Virgo and an INTJ), Charlene ensures everything is done to a T, always double
            (and even triple) checking so that everything is operating at 110%.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Despite initial resistances, Charlene ultimately followed the recommendations of multiple art teachers to
            study at RMIT University. Choosing the Bachelor of Design (Digital Media), she hopes to one day be able to
            enter the professional circles of digital design.

        </p>
        <p>
            Oft praised for her creativity and flexibility, Charlene takes inspiration from the media she consumes,
            often implementing elements into her own work and creating new takes on old ideas.

        </p>
        <p>
            Highly dedicated to her work, the only way to truly pull Charlene away from her tasks is a good book, though
            she'll quickly be back with the new inspiration and ideas she has gained from her reading session.

        <h2 id="A1_link">Assignment 1</h2>

        <p>
            The first assignment required students to create a completely new storyline with only two video resources:
            one for the visual aspect, and the other for the voiceover. Despite these limitations, I had wanted to
            create what could be described as a combination of "Home Alone" and the "Mandela Catalogue".
        </p>
        <p>
            The original video "Alone at Home" espouses safety at home, being an instructional video for children left
            alone in their house. I wanted to create the opposite: that no matter how safe one perceives their home to
            be, there is still a threat. Ans so I created a story about a town haunted by something, and a little boy
            who was taken away by 'something' because they were left all alone in their house.

                        <h3>'Alone at Home' Video</h3>
                        <p>
                            Choosing a video after much consideration as to how the narrative of a story can be changed
                            along with the sequence of events.

        <h3>
            How I Made the Video
        </h3>
        <p>
            The already existing footage from the video resource I had chosen was very in-line with the story I was
            going to present. As the original video was about 14 minutes long, there was an ample number of scenes I
            could select to use as part of my assignment. I had first selected the scene of what I would like to have as
            the climax, which would be the most important scene for my project, before moving on to select the remaining
            scenes to build around it. This allowed me to create a narrative relatively quickly, as all I had to do was
            then create an introduction leading up to the climax, and an aftermath. I outlined everything that would
            happen in my video in a storyboard, so as to be able to quickly make any changes, as well as to have a
            reminder as to what the narrative will be so that I do not go off track in my work.

                            Sound effects and voiceover are carefully implemented to best convey the story shown.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            I wished to create a cohesive storyline, and so both the audio tracks and video edits used could not be
            too
            'separate'. For example, there cannot be any comical sound effects when there shouldn't be any. The
            entire
            piece should be very plot driven, a straight linear path from scene A to scene B. Both sound and
            voiceover
            were used to set the emotions of each scene. 
        </p>
        <p> Sound can be very influential in the emotional state of the
            person watching your story. For example, in the beginning scene of my project, I had a girl stand up
            from a
            table and walk over to a door. If it was just the original audio of the scene or complete silence,
            nothing
            would seem wrong with the situation; a girl is just walking over to a door because she heard something.
            But
            because I chose to have a segment cheerful music playing in the background - one that quickly fades as
            there's knocking heard - it creates a suspenseful mood to the scene. The audience can now sense that
            there's something wrong, that whatever's on the other side of the door is 'bad'.

                        <h3>Creating the Climax</h3>
                        <p>
                            Varying the audio levels ensures that the audience is always kept on the edge of their seats,
                            and are drawn into the video. The video is edited so that there is continuity and that the
                            sequencing makes sense, so that the audience can make sense of the story.

            The second assignment required students to create a set of 9 different icons and their corresponding audio
            upon interaction. Several different concepts were given, and we were to choose one of them to base the icon
            designs after.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to portray three different themes all linked to the concept of 'growth'. With growth, one would most
            often think of the natural world, so I wanted to portray things that grow in the sky, on the ground, and in
            the water.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How I Made the Icons
        </h3>
        <p>
            In order to create my icons, I sketched out everything in Adobe Photoshop first, before transferring
            them to Adobe Illustrator and tracing over each image with the line and curvature tools and adding colour.
        </p>
        <p>
            <div class="row_3">
                <div class="column_3">
                    <div class="content">
                        <img src="img/blue.png" alt="blue" style="width:100%"; float="center">
                        <h3>Implementing the backgrounds</h3>
                        <p>
                            Putting in the backgrounds of each icon. Analogous colours are used to ensure that the icons 
                            do not strain the when looked at for a prolonged period of time.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="column_4">
                    <div class="content">
                        <img src="img/two.png" alt="two" style="width:100%"; float="center">
                        <h3>Creating Change</h3>
                        <p>
                            Making two versions of each icon (the before and after) so that there can be a visible change 
                            in the icons for the audience to see. This further enforces the concept of 'growth'.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            As we need to have a set of 9 icons in total, I decided to divide them into rows of three representing
            growth in 'Earth', 'Water' and 'Sky'. For all three rows, I chose to have the background square shaped.
            Analogous colours (blue, teal/turquoise, green) were used in order to appear more unified and a common theme
            of lines running across each background was added. For the 'Earth' themed icons, they were to have rigid
            brown lines, for 'Water' themed they were to have wavy blue lines and for 'Sky' themed they were to have
            swirly white lines. I also tried to keep the art-style as similar as possible, so one icon doesn't look too
            simplistic or complicated next to the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
            To further enhance the concept of growth, I had made it so that people can visually see the growth. For each
            Icon, once clicked and held, a change can be seen, such as a lotus flower growing in height, or a butterfly coming
            out of its chrysalis.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the sound portion of this assignment, seeing as I had my icons transition from one appearance to the
            other, I made sure each sound clip I had chosen for the audio design matched with the sound normally heard
            in the context of each icon scene. For the potted plant I used the sounds of leaves rustling, for the bird with a
            nest I used the sounds of an egg cracking and birds chirping. Ultimately, I wanted the audio to as closely
            match with the scenes depicted in the icons as much as possible.

                        <h3>Coding</h3>
                        <p>
                            Implementing the audio clips into Visual Studio Code and linking them to the icons. Like this, 
                            when one interacts with the icons by clicking on them, the audio clips should be able to play.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            All of this was made possible through visual studio code, which was in of itself a challenge to use unless you have
            a great eye for detail (and passible spelling abilities), which I thnakfully do have. Every line written down has to be
            heavily scrutinised as the slightest error can result in the entire webpage with the icons not functioning, whether it
            be the audio not playing out or even just the icons themselves not appearing on screen.

        <h2 id="A3_link">Assignment 3</h2>
        <p>
            The third assignment required students to create a 3D environment using the game engine Unity. We had to
            have a 'parti' to form and influence our environment - the two must be connected. My chosen 'parti' was 
            maturation (or growth) through life. It is meant to reflect on how as a person gets older, they experience 
            more events in life (both good and bad) that shape who they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having a working prototype throughout this assignment was vital to the completion of my 3D environment. It
            helped me get the general idea of how my project was going to turn out visually and as an interactive
            space. It also helped me understand which assets need to be changed or moved so that I (and those who play
            the game) are not clipped out of the 3D enviironment.

                        <h3>The Mirrorverse</h3>
                        <p>
                            These mirrors in which you can either see your own reflection or another world was inspired 
                            from the 'Persona' series. Mirrors, I also find, are interesting in that it shows a world 
                            that you are both familiar and unfamilar with, and I wanted to further expand on this concept.

                            Creating the scenes in which you can actually enter as part of the 3D environment. This allows 
                            for the player to explore some of the most important parts of my friend's life that shaped them. 
                            Of course, there are some scenes you can't enter, which represents parts of my friend's life that 
                            was cut off.

            One compulsory aspect of this assignment was the virtual camera. The virtual camera was to act as the
            point-of-view of a person in a gallery. It was to portray the POV of an outsider looking into the life of
            someone else. It was similar in function to the role of the camera in Assignment 1. However, whereas the
            camera in the first assignment is completely removed from the situation occurring in the video, the camera
            used in Assignment 3 is still within the 'area'. It is interactive - although you are still an outsider
            looking into another person's life, you have the choice to see what you look at.
        </P>
        <p>
            Sound is another crucial part of this assignment, and its implementation is vastly different from the
            previous assignments. Sound in Assignment 1 is loud. It is a constant thing with only very brief periods of
            silence. It is easy to implement, as all one must do is to take pre-recorded clips of audio and add them to
            video edit. Sound in Assignment 2 is quieter and is only used to enhance the concept behind the icons.
            Compared to Assignment 1, it was slightly harder to implement, as one must include it into the coding of a
            website, as well as link it to the icons to ensure that the audio is played when triggered the correct way.
            For Assignment 3, however, sound needs to be three dimensional as well. You need to be able to hear the same
            sound from multiple directions and not just one, and sound in the 3D environment had to operate in a similar
            fashion to sound in the real world.

            For my presentation method, I had chosen to display the 3D environment as an art gallery. Every scene that
            depicts my 'parti' is seen first behind either a painting frame or a glass case. For the frames that you can
            enter, the scenes behind them are all fairly cartoon like and scaled not so realistic to enforce the idea of
            these scenes being a person's memory, and like most memories, distorted and coloured by the owner's own
            perception of events.

                        <p>The gallery format I chose to use as my 3D environment. As can be seen, the white space is the 
                            main floor of the gallery, whilst the surrounding boxes all contain scenes that can be viewed 
                            through the mirrors in the gallery.
