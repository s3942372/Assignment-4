                Assignment 1: Video Editing
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <section class="section section-dark">
        <h2 id="A1_link">Assignment 1: Video Editing</h2>

        <p>
            The first assignment required students to create a completely new storyline with only two video resources:
            one for the visual aspect, and the other for the voiceover. Despite these limitations, I had wanted to
            create what could be described as a combination of "Home Alone" and the "Mandela Catalogue".
        </p>
        <p>
            The original video "Alone at Home" espouses safety at home, being an instructional video for children left
            alone in their house. I wanted to create the opposite: that no matter how safe one perceives their home to
            be, there is still a threat. Ans so I created a story about a town haunted by something, and a little boy
            who was taken away by 'something' because they were left all alone in their house.
        </p>
        <p>
            The already existing footage from the video resource I had chosen was very in-line with the story I was
            going to present. As the original video was about 14 minutes long, there was an ample number of scenes I
            could select to use as part of my assignment. I had first selected the scene of what I would like to have as
            the climax, which would be the most important scene for my project, before moving on to select the remaining
            scenes to build around it. This allowed me to create a narrative relatively quickly, as all I had to do was
            then create an introduction leading up to the climax, and an aftermath.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wished to create a cohesive storyline, and so both the audio tracks and video edits used could not be too
            'separate'. For example, there cannot be any comical sound effects when there shouldn't be any. The entire
            piece should be very plot driven, a straight linear path from scene A to scene B. Both sound and voiceover
            were used to set the emotions of each scene. Sound can be very influential in the emotional state of the
            person watching your story. For example, in the beginning scene of my project, I had a girl stand up from a
            table and walk over to a door. If it was just the original audio of the scene or complete silence, nothing
            would seem wrong with the situation; a girl is just walking over to a door because she heard something. But
            because I chose to have a segment cheerful music playing in the background - one that quickly fades as
            there's knocking heard - it creates a suspenseful mood to the scene. The audience can now sense that there's
            something wrong, that whatever's on the other side of the door is 'bad'.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, the edits make the pacing slow. I had kept the scenes long to slowly build the tension. However,
            as the video enters the climax of the storm scene, there is faster edits, there are many cuts in a few
            seconds, to make the scenes seem more frantic. After the climax, the edits slow down again and the tension
            dies back down.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to create a juxtaposition between the climax and the other scenes. The storm scene is dark and
            suspenseful. It is the climax of the entire project and needs to stand out against every other scene. And
            so, it is the scene with the most amount of layering in the audio too. Everything during this scene is
            maximised in order to best convey that the storm scene is the important one; that here is where things don't
            look so good for the boy. Contrastingly, the scenes before and after the storm scene is very minimalistic.
            Very little audio is used, and what is used is always quick to die down. the scenes are also light,
            appearing to be daytime as opposed to the storm scene's night, to further enhance the contrast between the
            two. It is very much a horror-within-a-sleepy-little-town vibe, in which most characters except a select one
            (or few) are unaware of the horrors within their town.

                Assignment 2: Icon Design

    <section class="section section-dark">
        <h2 id="A2_link">Assignment 2: Icon Design</h2>
        <p>
            The second assignment required students to create a set of 9 different icons and their corresponding audio
            upon interaction. Several different concepts were given, and we were to choose one of them to base the icon
            designs after.
        </p>
        <p>
            I originally wanted to choose the concept of 'dream'. However, I had quickly realised that 'dream' would be
            too complicated, and anything I drew would be very detail-heavy, so I had instead chosen the concept of
            'growth', since no one was apparently doing that one.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to portray three different themes all linked to the concept of growth. With growth, one would most
            often think of the natural world, so I wanted to portray things that grow in the sky, on the ground, and in
            the water.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many different iterations were created to portray the concept of 'growth'. Ultimately, I did land on growth
            in the natural world, since it is the theme that can most easily be conveyed the concept between the icons.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to create my icons, I simply sketched out everything in Adobe Photoshop first, before transferring
            them to Adobe Illustrator and tracing over everything with the line and curvature tools and adding colour.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we need to have a set of 9 icons in total, I decided to divide them into rows of three representing
            growth in 'Earth', 'Water' and 'Sky'. For all three rows, I chose to have the background square shaped.
            Analogous colours (blue, teal/turquoise, green) were used in order to appear more unified and a common theme
            of lines running across each background was added. For the 'Earth' themed icons, they were to have rigid
            brown lines, for 'Water' themed they were to have wavy blue lines and for 'Sky' themed they were to have
            swirly white lines. I also tried to keep the art-style as similar as possible, so one icon doesn't look too
            simplistic or complicated next to the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
            To further enhance the concept of growth, I had made it so that people can visually see the growth. For each
            Icon, once clicked, a change can be seen, such as a lotus flower growing in height, or a butterfly coming
            out of its chrysalis.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the sound portion of this assignment, seeing as I had my icons transition from one appearance to the
            other, I made sure each sound clip I had chosen for the audio design matched with the sound normally heard
            in the context of each icon scene. For the plant I used the sounds of leaves rustling, for the bird with a
            nest I used the sounds of an egg cracking and birds chirping. Ultimately, I wanted the audio to as closely
            match with the scenes depicted in the icons as much as possible.

                Assignment 3: 3D Environment Design
            </span>

    </div>
    <section class="section section-dark">
        <h2 id="A3_link">Assignment 3: 3D Environment Design</h2>
        <p>
            The third assignment required students to create a 3D environment using the game engine Unity. We had to
            have a 'parti' to form and influence our environment - the two must be connected.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was so, so much harder compared to the previous two, especially since I unfortunately suffer
            from cybersickness, so that makes it all the more difficult. With 2D media, All I had to focus on is how
            something appears front on. However, with the 3D environment, I had to figure out how everything looked from
            all sides and directions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having a working prototype throughout this assignment was vital to the completion of my 3D environment. It
            helped me get the general idea of what my project was going to turn out like visually and as an interactive
            space. It also helped me understand which assets need to be changed or moved so that I (and those who play
            the game) are not clipped out of the world and into the void.
        </p>
        <P>
            One compulsory aspect of this assignment was the virtual camera. The virtual camera was to act as the
            point-of-view of a person in a gallery. It was to portray the POV of an outsider looking into the life of
            someone else. It was similar in function to the role of the camera in Assignment 1. However, whereas the
            camera in the first assignment is completely removed from the situation occurring in the video, the camera
            used in Assignment 3 is still within the 'area'. It is interactive - although you are still an outsider
            looking into another person's life, you have the choice to see what you look at.
        </P>
        <p>
            Sound is another crucial part of this assignment, and its implementation is vastly different from the
            previous assignments. Sound in Assignment 1 is loud. It is a constant thing with only very brief periods of
            silence. It is easy to implement, as all one must do is to take pre-recorded clips of audio and add them to
            video edit. Sound in Assignment 2 is quieter and is only used to enhance the concept behind the icons.
            Compared to Assignment 1, it was slightly harder to implement, as one must include it into the coding of a
            website, as well as link it to the icons to ensure that the audio is played when triggered the correct way.
            For Assignment 3, however, sound needs to be three dimensional as well. You need to be able to hear the same
            sound from multiple directions and not just one, and sound in the 3D environment had to operate in a similar
            fashion to sound in the real world.
        </p>
        <P>
            For my presentation method, I had chosen to display the 3D environment as an art gallery. Every scene that
            depicts my 'parti' is seen first behind either a painting frame or a glass case. For the frames that you can
            enter, the scenes behind them are all fairly cartoon like and scaled not so realistic to enforce the idea of
            these scenes being a person's memory, and like most memories, distorted and coloured by the owner's own
            perception of events.
